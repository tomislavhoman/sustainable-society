Collection of documents to use when needing an advice regarding sustainability 

## Food
-  Buy local and seasonal food, no need to buy summer food in winter, or if you do have cravings for it buy (or do it yourself) pickled or in another way preserved version

- Avoid supermarkets in general, buy there only the things that are not available locally

- Eat less meat, it's more unsustainable and unhealthy to eat meat and meat products every day. 

- Try growing some of your own food. You can find a local organization or small business that keeps local seeds from dying out. For example: [Biovrt](https://www.biovrt.com/)

## Clothing
-  Prefer clothing brands that promote unisex, one-size-fits-all models, that are against fast fashion and use quality materials that are durable, so you can wear e.g. one T-shirt for a long time, or even swap with friends or let your kids inherit it. Example [Older brother]( https://olderbrother.us) or [Patagonia](https://www.patagonia.com/home/)

- Always look for the *About us*, *Ethical manifesto* or *Our values* page before you buy from any brand. See what their promise is, then you can research whether or not they stand behind it

- Try to repair or repurpose clothes before throwing it away

- Use [eco-egg](https://www.ecoegg.com) instead of detergents to wash the clothes. It is a good replacement for more than 50% of your wash cycles. Otherwise, look for detergents that are natural and come in a cardbox. If you use softener, use it less and also find one that is not toxic for the environment

- Develop a style and then keep smaller amount of clothing in your closet (20 pieces e.g.) instead of just hoarding something that you barely wore once. Don't buy in batches. Buy one piece at a time and make sure you build up slowly. This way you probably won't end up with any unworn items

- If you want to get rid of piece of clothes give it away if it's in a good shape or place it in textile recycle bin if it's busted

- If a piece of clothes is suspiciously cheap investigate that company and find out why is it so cheap - they are probably misstreating their workers 

## Plastic
- Use cloth bags instead of disposable plastic ones. [Example](https://www.ecobags.com/Our_Products/Produce_Bags)

- Invest in one quality steel bottle and refill ot with water instead of using plastic bottles. Ask in the cafe bar to refill it (if they reject it they are not cool) or use a fountain in the city you are currently in

- Use wooden tooth brush, plastic-less ear sticks, solid soap (doesn't come in plastic bottle), powder detergent packed in carton instead of liquid one (or even better eco-egg)

- Know your plastic, not all the plastic is recycleable. Even during recycling part of it ends up being micro-plastic and the recycling procedure itself has a carbon footprint

- Try using eco-friendly resuable plastic wrappers replacement that you can use to store your food. For example [Bee's Wrap](https://www.beeswrap.com/)

## General shopping
- When you decide to buy something non-essential, postpone it for 2 weeks and then re-think about if you still need it

- Do the research about the manufacturer whose product you are buying, what materials is it using, how is it treating its employees, where is it doing the manufacturing

- Try to see through marketing, don't fall for it, don't shop to feel happier, block ads, chose the content you consume 

- Prefer zero-waste manufacturers, but don't trust them just because they say they are zero-waste, investigate it

- Buy quality products that will last long, don't have plastic and are more easily repairable, modular or upgradeable. Most of the products today are designed for waste, they are planned to become obsolete

- Be mindful about greenwashing - big companies offering same products under different green brand, or telling they are giving away an X amount of money to something for every buck you spend

- Separate and recycle your waste (but try to make less waste)

## Information technology
- Psihology, bubbles, don't compare yourself to others, because you are comparing yourself to the picture others present about themselves on social networks which is false. Social networks don't promote sustainable psychology

- Similar to physical products designed for waste, most of the news portals and individual content generators are under preassure to deliver more content regardless of quality, so ignore them, they are wasting your valuable time. Investigate and choose just a couple of content producers that deliver less, but maintain quality. Think about supporting them on Patreon or buying subscription if it's a magazine or portal. Try to find news sources that are financed from subscribers and don't have ads (Financial times, The Guardian...). If you value their reporting, become a subscriber yourself and support free journalism.

- See if there are content producers that suit you and that try to use as less energy as possible, [this one for example](https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/)

## TBD
- There needs to be some fact-checking done to see how much can individuals influence sustainibility versus big companies. In other words, does it make sense for me to fight when big companies pollute "in a day more than I can save in a year". Even if it's true it makes sense to put political preassure to punish such a companies and economical preassure directly on those companies by not buying their products

- Spread the word, as idea is spreading like a virus, maybe you think you don't have the influence, but it takes some time for it to brew before society accepts it
